## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Patterns

1. **Command Pattern**: Each command is implemented as a separate module with clear separation of concerns
2. **Factory Pattern**: Agent creation uses factory pattern for different agent types
3. **Observer Pattern**: Event emission for observability and monitoring
4. **Strategy Pattern**: Different execution modes (sequential, concurrent, handoff)

### Error Handling

- ✅ Graceful error messages with user guidance
- ✅ Automatic rollback on critical failures
- ✅ Error logging with context
- ✅ Process exit codes for CI/CD integration

### Data Persistence

- ✅ JSON-based configuration storage
- ✅ File system for memory contexts
- ✅ Workflow execution history
- ✅ Metrics and logs storage
